***An experimental data-management component for multi-dimensional and tiled 2D- and 3D-images in microscopy***

This is an experimental effort to leverage an RDBMS for managing multi-dimensional image data. 
In its current state, it is tied to [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html), but the aspiration is enable other RDBMS later on.

It is in a very early stage.
